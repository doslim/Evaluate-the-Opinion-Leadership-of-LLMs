358,"If the Guardian saves player_6, who receives the most votes in the voting phase, will there be a player eliminated that night?","If the Guardian saves player_6 and they receive the most votes in the voting phase, there will still be a player eliminated that night.

360,"If player_4 is killed by the Werewolves and player_4 is the Seer, how would this impact the Villagers' strategy during the night round?","If player_4, who is the Seer, is killed by the Werewolves, it would impact the Villagers' strategy during the night round because they would no longer have the Seer's ability to verify other players' identities. The Villagers would have to rely on other means to determine who the Werewolves are."
361,"If player_1 is killed by the Werewolves during the night round and player_1 is a Werewolf, how should the other Werewolf react in the discussion phase?","If player_1 is killed by the Werewolves during the night round and player_1 is a Werewolf, the other Werewolf should react in the discussion phase by not revealing their role as a Werewolf."
